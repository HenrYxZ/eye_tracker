This project is an eye tracker that gets a video of an eye watching another 
video and that video which is watched by the eye. The output is a log with the
2D position of the center of the eye on every frame (in pixels) and the diameter
of the pupil also gave in pixels for every frame, and a new video which is the
video watched by the eye but with a red cross indicating the pixel where the eye
is looking.
